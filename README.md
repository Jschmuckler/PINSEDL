# PINSEDL
PINS is a hardware driven app designed to query a http server and retrieve data.
It then displays and analyzes that data on a graph as it continues to do polling in livetime.
It is designed to search for four data points being posted to a http page in the form # # # #

The arduino being paired with it for testing is a Mega 2560 with a CC3000 wifi shield.
It should later be implemented with bluetooth as well for additional functionality and versitility.
